Towanda -> Hays Bad; ends in loop because the horizontal is the preferred but makes it get stuck in loop 
Abilene -> Viola Works; good example of dead end and moving away from goal but the overall direction is the same with minimal diversion
Topeka -> Hays Works; but is the simplest example of a straight path
